## Overview
I built this week's assignment partly off of last week's. I again created several lines that moved around the screen independently of each other and changed color with each refresh of the browser window.

## Steps
1. Because of the complexity of working with classes and objects, I built up the sketch step by step and did not move on to the next step until I was sure the current step was working. I fixed any errors and bugs before moving on.
2. I created the class for 'Lines' and added variables for the beginning and ending coordinates and a variable for color. I then wrote the methods that would:
    a. Create each line.
    b. Move the beginning coordinates of the next line to the ending coordinates of the previous line so as to make it look as if the lines were growing by sections.
    c.
