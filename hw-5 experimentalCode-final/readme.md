# Mark Lannen HW-5 Recap

## Overview
As usual, this week's project was both interesting and challenging. I made an initial decision when setting up my canvas that came back to cause problems, which I will discuss below. The bulk of my time was spent getting my animations to work. I gained a decent understanding of the core concepts, and found the most challenging aspect in getting the eyes in my sketch to spin around their own axis.
