# Homework 10 Overview
1. I wanted to create a generative sketch that started with a certain # of lines that then grew and spread around the canvas. I struggled getting started this week as it is still difficult for me to know where to begin on a more complext program.
2. I got the sketch as far as generating the lines and moving them across the screen but then got stuck when trying to get the 'bounce' off the edge of the screen. I eventually took my sketch in to Dr. Musick and he talked me through several issues and helped me set up the bones of the code. I was close to getting what I wanted but need his help to get help walk me through the logic of how to make it work. I was especcialy having issues keeping the lines 'in bounds.'
3. I then adjusted the # of lines and how the beginning and ending coordinates were calculated to have more variation in each draw loop.

## Issues

1. I had another issue with a github merge conflict that Quinn helped me with several times. We 'might' have gotten the problem solved, but I may need to take it to Dr. Musick for final resolution. Over the Spring Break weekend I worked through some of a Udemy Github course so that hopefully I can eventually solve these issues myself.  :)
2. In terms of making the sketch work, the biggest issue I had was making the lines 'bounce'  of the edge of the window. I posted some of my code on the Git issues board and did get a few helpful responses, but could not make it really work until Dr. Musick talked me through some of the logic. I think what was tripping me up was that I did not have the math correct and the lines were going of the screen and not returning. We fixed this by creating two if statements that 'bounced' the ending x and ending y coordinates based on when the beginning x and y coordinates got to the edge of the screen.
3. The last issue I had I was never able to solve. I wanted to write a function that gave the same color to every line that was generated from a particular index point in the array. I tried dozens of variations of writing the function, but could just not get it to work.

## Conclusions
All in all I'm very happy with this sketch though getting it to work, and completely understanding what is going on is pushing my skill and understanding at the moment. I left code of the function commented out.

My favorite part of the sketch is that the colors are randomized every time one refreshes the page. I have spent quite a bit of time refreshing the page repeatedly to see if any good color schemes randomly arise.
