# Final Project Proposal

## Title: Floating Kandinsky

### Overview
I would like to create a sketch in p5 that takes its inspiration from the abstract works of Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky. Many of his works could be considered 'geometric,' and I think would lend themselves well to being the inspiration for a sketch in p5.

What I want to do is write code that will manifest a new abstract work of art with each refresh of the browser, with different colors, geometric shapes and sizes, and some variation in where these elements are placed. Also, I want the sketch to have functionality so that if the program is left to run, the elements will move about the canvas and interact with each other, continually creating new compositions.
