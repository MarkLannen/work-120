I would like to create a sketch in p5 that takes its inspiration from the abstract works of Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky. Many of his works could be considered 'geometric,' and I think would lend themselves well to being the inspiration for a sketch in p5.

What I want to do is write code that will manifest a new abstract work of art with each refresh of the browser, with different colors, geometric shapes and sizes, and some variation in where these elements are placed.

## Problems to solve

Even though abstract art often looks completely spontaneous and chaotic, it was often meticulously planned and executed. Kandinsky in particular used to
