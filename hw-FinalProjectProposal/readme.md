# Final Project Proposal - Title: Floating Kandinsky

## Overview

I would like to create a sketch in p5 that takes its inspiration from the abstract works of Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky. Many of his works could be considered 'geometric,' and I think would lend themselves well to being the inspiration for a sketch in p5.

What I want to do is write code that will manifest a new abstract work of art with each refresh of the browser, with different colors, geometric shapes and sizes, and some variation in where these elements are placed. Also, I want the sketch to evolve so that if the program is left to run, the elements will move about the canvas and interact with each other, continually creating new compositions.

I think it could randomly produce some interesting results, but what I am really interested in is seeing if through randomizing these elements' creation and movement, a new composition that 'works' as an abstract image will be created.

## Problems to solve

Even though abstract art often looks completely spontaneous and chaotic, it was often meticulously planned and executed. Kandinsky in particular planned his abstract works very carefully, so I will need to do the same when writing my code.

I think I will need to divide geometric elements into groups and code them as classes that I will then use to create a certain number of similar objects. It will be challenging for me to create a class that will be flexible enough to several similar but distinct objects.

A challenge I envision having is that I would prefer to not create elements that are made up of only one color. I would prefer to go at least some way towards creating fill and stroke colors that look something like what you would see in a painting on canvas, with it's textures and gradients. I don't know if that is possible and will have to research it.

Another challenge I see is coming up with an effective way of moving all the elements. Coding movement hasn't been easy for me, which is partly why I wanted to include a strong element of it in my final project so that I could finally get my head around how to do it!
