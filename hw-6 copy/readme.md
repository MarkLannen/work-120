# Mark Lannen HW-6 Recap

## Overview
I found this the most challenging project to date. The main issue for me was that with no particular form to work on drawing, I found it hard to know where to begin. I eventually decided to just start creating some shapes and animations at random and then start using the math functions to manipulate them and actively develop the piece as I went on. I struggled particularly with the map and % requirements of the assignment.

## Process
1. I first created 2 sets of ellipses, declared variables for all their attributes, including color. I then did the same thing for a smaller group of ellipses and 2 groups of rectangles. Lastly, I divided the canvas in quarters and filled each quarter with one set of shapes.
2. I then set random animations to distribute ellipses of various sizes, shapes and colors around the screen using as many of the math operators and functions as possible.
3. Lastly, I used the map function to increase and decrease the size of the elements based on how near or far they were from the centre of the canvas.
