# Homework 8 Overview
1. I started a sketch that used nested for loops to create a series of arc across the x and y axis. I randomlyincremented their size.
2. I then used more nested for loops to create a series of ellipses in the top left quadrant and rectangles in the bottom right quadrant. I set the fill color for all of these with an alpha value of 0.5 so that the arcs would show through.
3. I then wrote a series of if else statements that changed the fill color depending which quadrant of the sketch the mouse is on.

## Issues

The biggest obstacle I encountered was a merge conflict in github. I asked for help on the github issues board, and despite a few useful suggestions I was not able to resolve it myself. So I went to the lab and spoke to Quinn who managed to solve the problem. I understand in general what causes these merge conflicts, but I didn't really understand the details of what he did to solve it. I will have to put some time in to really understanding git and github.

Another issue was trying to use variables for an rgba value. I couldn't get them to work, and spent some time with Emily in the lab but neither of us could figure it out. My guess is that something in the fact that rgba is a string in p5 is causing my attempts to pass variables to a fill that is causing the problem. When I get a chance I will talk to Stephanie and see if she can clear it up for me.

## Conclusions

I was pleased that I eventually managed to get the if else statements and nested for loops to work, even if it was only a relatively simple sketch. My next homework assignment I would like to try a piece of generative art, as I only have a tenuous understanding of how the examples in the course so far are working.
