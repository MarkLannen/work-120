# HW-03 Responses

I enjoyed this week. It was very useful to spend time using atom and github as I am getting more familiar with them and am starting to be able to intuit my way aroung them a bit. I still need to reference the course and online material regularly in order to understand what I am doing and getting them to do what I want.

I also tried to use the command line in terminal as much as possible in order to carry on familiarizing myself with that technology. I can't say I'm proficient at it yet, and I still get a bit lost when navigating through directories and making and deleting new ones, but I would say that I am getting a little less lost than I had been the first two weeks.

It was great to actually make a first sketch. The biggest priority for me was to really understand the syntax that was introduced this week and make sure I could create a canvas and draw some text from scratch without having to look at the documentation. I spent some time looking at the p5 reference page on colors and experimented with using rgb codes to change the background.

The only 'issues' I had this week were related to manually typing in the code into atom and leaving out quotation marks, forgetting to put them in
